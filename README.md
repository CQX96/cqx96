CQX96
=====

The CQX96 kernel is a free DOS/UNIX like kernel for the intel (x86).


CQX96 is written in assembly.

All contributions are welcome.




Currently, CQX96 supports the FAT file system.

This operating system has been tested and worked on these computers:
  1. Acer Aspire 3690
  2. Some HP computer I don't know the model

FEATURES
========

CQX96 has a custom interrupt number: int 96h
It also has FAT filesystem support

CQX96 DOES NOT COME WITH A SHELL BY DEFAULT!
You can compile the shell template at https://github.com/CQX96/cqx96-apps/blob/main/shelltemplate.asm

NOTE 1
======

This project uses some code from different authors. (people from Stack Overflow and MikeOS)


The snippets from MikeOS are in the include\mike directory (note that we did change some stuff).

NOTE 2
======

This is my second operating system (My first one was very bad).

Technically it is not my second operating system, but others were for learning, so...
